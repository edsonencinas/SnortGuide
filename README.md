#How to Install and Configure Snort as an IDS and IPS

Introduction

In todayâ€™s cybersecurity landscape, intrusion detection and prevention are critical to safeguarding your network. Snort, an open-source network intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS), is widely used by security professionals worldwide. It offers real-time traffic analysis and packet logging, making it a powerful tool for monitoring and protecting your network.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to install and configure Snort on a Linux system (Ubuntu/Debian-based). The process involves installing necessary dependencies, compiling Snort, and setting it up as both an IDS and IPS.

Prerequisites

A Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 or similar)
Root or sudo privileges
Basic understanding of Linux command line

Step 1: Update Your System

First, ensure your system packages are up-to-date:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Snort requires several dependencies:

sudo apt install -y build-essential libpcap-dev libpcre3-dev libdumbnet-dev \
zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev openssl libssl-dev libnghttp2-dev \
libnet1-dev libyaml-dev libjemalloc-dev libhwloc-dev \
libnetfilter-queue-dev libnetfilter-log-dev

Additionally, install other tools:

sudo apt install -y wget snort

Step 3: Download and Install Snort

You can install Snort from the official repositories or compile from source for the latest version.

Option 1: Install via apt (simpler, but may not be latest):

sudo apt install snort

Option 2: Compile from source for latest features:

Download the latest Snort source code from the https://www.snort.org/downloads.

wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/snort-.tar.gz

Replace `` with the current version.

Extract and compile:

tar -xzf snort-*.tar.gz
cd snort-*/
./configure --enable-sourcefire
make
sudo make install

Step 4: Download Snort Rules

Snort uses rules to identify malicious traffic.

Register at https://snort.org/ to get a free or paid rule set.
Download the Community Rules:

wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/community/community-rules.tar.gz
tar -xzf community-rules.tar.gz -C /etc/snort/rules

Place your rules in /etc/snort/rules/.

Step 5: Configure Snort

Create configuration directories:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/snort
sudo mkdir -p /etc/snort/rules
sudo mkdir -p /etc/snort/preproc_rules
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/snort
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules

Copy the sample configuration files:

sudo cp /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.conf.example /etc/snort/snort.conf

Edit /etc/snort/snort.conf:

Set the HOME_NET variable to your network:

var HOME_NET [192.168.1.0/24]

Point to the rules directory:

include $RULE_PATH/community-rules.rules

Step 6: Run Snort as IDS

To test Snort in IDS mode (monitoring traffic without blocking):

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

Replace eth0 with your network interface.

Step 7: Configure Snort as an IPS

To enable Snort in IPS mode (block malicious traffic), you'll need to run it with the -Q option and inline mode, which requires a special configuration:

Install the libnetfilter_queue library:

sudo apt install libnetfilter-queue-dev

Enable inline mode in snort.conf by setting the config policy_mode:

config policy_mode:inline

Run Snort with NFQUEUE:

sudo snort -Q --daq nfq --daq-show --daq-var queue=0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

You may need to set up iptables rules to redirect traffic to the NFQUEUE:

sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

This setup allows Snort to inspect and block traffic in real-time.

Conclusion

Installing Snort as an IDS and IPS provides robust network security capabilities. While this guide covers the basics, deploying Snort effectively involves ongoing rule management, tuning, and integration with other security tools.

Remember: Always test your configuration in a controlled environment before deploying it into production to avoid unintended network disruptions.
